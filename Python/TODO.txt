=== Edge degradation

- Lancer gq_ER_ksi=1 with nRun=1000 (directed/undirected)
- Lancer gq_ER_zeta=1 with nRun=1000 (directed/undirected)

=== Node degradation (subgraph)

- Redo delta_p_star in logarithmic scale
- degradation plots with cat. and meas. 

=== Supplementary

* Accuracy vs Niterations
* Normalization coefficient
* Speed

=== To check

3.3: "... the matching obtained via the update equations (14-15) and (17-18) are rigorously equal."
