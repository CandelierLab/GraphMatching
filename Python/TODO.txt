=== Supplementary

* Influence of noise (directed / undirected)
* Accuracy and qS vs Niterations
* Normalization coefficient

=== Speed benchmark

* ER with p=nlog(n)
* QAPLIB total time (4 algorithms + GASM_GPU)
  
=== Edge degradation

- Finalization figure 

=== Node degradation (subgraph)

- Finish delta_p_star in logarithmic scale:
  ðŸ®± n=10
  ðŸ®± n=20
  ðŸ®± n=50
  ðŸ®± n=100
  ðŸ®± n=200
  x n=500 
  x n=1000 

- degradation plots measurable attibutes

- degradation plots categorical ?


=== To check

3.3: "... the matching obtained via the update equations (14-15) and (17-18) are rigorously equal."
