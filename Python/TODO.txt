=== CUDA

* Speedup
* Computation: remove first instance and rerun everything

=== Supplementary

* Influence of noise (directed / undirected)
* Accuracy and qS vs Niterations
* Normalization coefficient

=== Speed benchmark

* ER with p=nlog(n)
* QAPLIB total time (4 algorithms + GASM_GPU)
  
=== Node degradation (subgraph)

- Finish delta_p_star in logarithmic scale:
  ðŸ®± n=10
  ðŸ®± n=20
  ðŸ®± n=50
  ðŸ®± n=100
  ðŸ®± n=200
  ðŸ®± n=500 
  x n=1000 

- Same for undirected ?

=== Attribute degradation (add noise)

x Edge degradation: FAQ and GASM
x Vertex degradation: GASM only

=== To check

3.3: "... the matching obtained via the update equations (14-15) and (17-18) are rigorously equal."
