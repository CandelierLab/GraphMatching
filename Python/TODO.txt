=== Speed & complement

* Time as a function of p on poly
* Is it beneficial to take the compelement for GPU ? If so, implement it.
* Supp fig: time as function of p, with and without complement for CPU

=== CUDA

* QAPlib:
  - fix GPU: first pass is on the non-reversed network !! Keep the complementary for GPU ? 
  - run
  - figure

=== Supplementary

* Influence of noise (directed / undirected)
* Accuracy and qS vs Niterations
 
=== Node degradation (subgraph)

- Finish delta_p_star in logarithmic scale:
  ðŸ®± n=10
  ðŸ®± n=20
  ðŸ®± n=50
  ðŸ®± n=100
  ðŸ®± n=200
  ðŸ®± n=500 
  x n=1000 

- Figure

=== Attribute degradation (add noise)

x Edge degradation: FAQ and GASM
x Vertex degradation: GASM only

=== To check

3.3: "... the matching obtained via the update equations (14-15) and (17-18) are rigorously equal."
